### Game 1 (lose)

Champ select:
- Enemy mid zed - Swain taken, so i kinda panic'd malphite
- Dan went for Brand to give AP

Notes:
- quii on malph, little impact. Did fine in lane, but zed roamed, guess i didnt react well enough. Perhaps not shoving waves quick enough to get on map?
- Brand, hard to hit combos on mobile comp
- Gold lead for enemy team starting climbing significantly at 15

Lessons?
- What is my anti-zed pic if Swain gone? Not malphite for sure
- Don't pick Brand against mobile team, unless you have very good setup
- Against zed i have to make sure i shove hard post 6, or i just give him window to roam

### Game 1 (Win)

Champ select

> Well fuckit they dont have tanks
Viego, Hwei

Hwei picked to counterpick aurora, but turned out wasn't mid

bebe got tilted by quinn pick, but actually she carried us

quii died slopily to zed a few times

### Game 2 (Win)

Champ Select
- Volibear for us
- Picked zilean to boost it, and to css darius and udyr

Irelia picked against me, initial thoughts, oh no

Post game

Hopeful gameplan was Dan carry, i support. it more or less worked. They had a very short range comp

### Game 3 (lost)

Champ select
- Dan picked Voli into Karthus
- Chris blind Ori, into Diana

Post game

Was a close one. Ended up with illaoi soaking up all our damage, we couldnt seem to get to their backline. There was a point where we were hitting their fountain. 

Another point where both teams were posturing around baron, but they had no turrets. We shouldn't let them dicate. Run it down. Be aware of open objectives, not just baron

### Game 4 (lost)

Champ select
- Chris blind Ori, into Hwei
- Dan sej into fiddle

Post game
- Felt we took some bad fights for objectives where we had no way of winning. Even if it's bad to give more grubbies, its worse to just take a fight against a fed top laner that we couldn't win
- Perhaps we could've peeled better for Samira, who was our win condition

## 4/8/2024

### Game 1 (Win)

Champ select
- Mumu blind, into bel. Mundo top for us
- Picked Hwei blind, but saw double ADC so needed range

Bebe played with some restraint for crab, very good bebe

Mid gapped. Did more roaming than maybe i normally would, but it worked out well, got a big lead early from them

### Game 2 (win)

Champ select
- Sej picked into noc
- quii unsure. Akali beats ekko, but worried about damage, so went Ori. Immediate concerns of being blasted

I did get blasted, very little impact. Bebe did fine. Darius carried us. **Don't sweat dmg charts too much. If i'm losing im not gonna do good damage anyway**

### Game 3 (Win)

Champ select
- Got a diving comp, Nilah
- Dan picked mumu into noc
- quii could be against neeko or brand, picked viktor. For range, and W againsat noc

We win!
- Need positive vibes. Yes we were 6k behind, but i thought they were shit.
- Viktor ftw
