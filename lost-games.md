# Lost game notes

## 2/8/24

### Game 1

Champ select:
- Swain taken, so i kinda panic'd malphite
- Dan went for Brand to give AP

Notes:
- quii on malph, little impact. Did fine in lane, but zed roamed, guess i didnt react well enough. Perhaps not shoving waves quick enough to get on map?
- Brand, hard to hit combos on mobile comp
- Gold lead for enemy team starting climbing significantly at 15
