# Lost game notes

### Game 1

Champ select:
- Enemy mid zed - Swain taken, so i kinda panic'd malphite
- Dan went for Brand to give AP

Notes:
- quii on malph, little impact. Did fine in lane, but zed roamed, guess i didnt react well enough. Perhaps not shoving waves quick enough to get on map?
- Brand, hard to hit combos on mobile comp
- Gold lead for enemy team starting climbing significantly at 15

Lessons?
- What is my anti-zed pic if Swain gone? Not malphite for sure
- Don't pick Brand against mobile team, unless you have very good setup
- Against zed i have to make sure i shove hard post 6, or i just give him window to roam
